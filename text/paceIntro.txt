This PACE report is intended to provide you with an overview of your performance at the Development Centre against each of the practical assessment centre exercises.  It is important to pay particular attention to those areas where you have demonstrated your strengths as well as considering areas for development. Performing well in Assessment Centres is as much about playing to our strengths as it is in developing our weaker areas.
