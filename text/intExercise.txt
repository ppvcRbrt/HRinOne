In this exercise we will look at a number of Motivational fit questions, followed by a competency-based question, and finally a strength-based interview question. 

Strength Based questions look at a combination of what people are good at and what they enjoy doing. It focuses on specific areas which motivate, naturally enthuse and excite candidates. 

Questions have been designed in relation to some of the strengths which are most heavily linked to success in the role you are applying for. We will look at your reasons and motivation for your application. As well as your ability to make informed decisions based on analysis and problem solving, including how you adapt to changing circumstances. Throughout the exercise you will be assessed by your Peers.
